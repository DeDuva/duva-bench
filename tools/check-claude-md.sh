# Fail if CLAUDE.md points at a path in this repository that no longer exists.
#
# CLAUDE.md here is mostly a set of pointers into docs/execution-plan.md, which is the
# plan of record. A pointer that has rotted is worse than no pointer: it sends the next
# agent to a section that no longer says what it is claimed to say. This asserts the
# paths at least still exist.
#
# What it checks: every backticked token in CLAUDE.md that looks like a repo-relative path
# and whose first segment is a tracked top-level entry must itself be tracked. Tokens
# rooted anywhere else — /api/adp, ~/.config, https://…, another repository's layout — are
# references to things outside this tree and are left alone.
